In the past few years, I have been dedicating my efforts to publish papers on top-tier conferences in computer security (CCS, IEEE S&P, Usenix Security, and NDSS). I also contribute to other well-regarded conferences in hardware security (e.g., DAC, DATE, and CHES). 

Publications at Conferences (3 papers): USENIX Security ('25)*2, DAC('25)

Publications at Journals (4 papers): The Computer Journal ('24)

Publications Ranking Statistics: 3 CCF-A papers (3 first-author), 1 CCF-B papers
